He escapes with the help of Ilsa Faust, an undercover British MI6 agent.

Upon Benji\\\\\\'s arrival in Vienna, Ethan asks him to help track down the blonde man who killed the IMF station operative in London.\\\\nAt the opera, they encounter Faust and several other Syndicate agents there to assassinate the Chancellor of Austria. Ethan prevents the hit and escapes with Faust, only to witness the Chancellor being killed by a car bomb. Chased by Syndicate agents, Ethan and Benji are forced to release Faust to protect her cover. Hunley blames both Ethan and Benji for the assassination and orders the Special Activities Division to capture or kill them both.

The AI becomes sentient and goes rogue. It deceives the crew into attacking a phantom target, only to be struck by their own torpedo, killing all aboard. IMF agent Ethan Hunt travels to the Empty Quarter of the Arabian Desert and successfully retrieves a key piece from Ilsa Faust, a disavowed MI6 agent, and also fakes her death to ensure she survives a bounty placed by an unknown source. Back in Washington, D.C., Ethan infiltrates a U.S. Intelligence Community briefing for Director of National Intelligence Denlinger discussing the rogue AI. They give it the title \"the Entity\" because of its sentience and defiance. CIA Director Eugene Kittridge states that the Entity can manipulate cyberspace, allowing it to control global defense intelligence and financial networks. World powers compete to obtain the cruciform key to control the Entity, though the exact means of controlling it are unknown.\\\\nEthan reveals himself and converses with Kittridge, who reveals that he was the one who placed Ilsa\\\\\\'s bounty. Ethan confesses his intention to destroy the Entity, knowing he would be considered rogue and is participating in a global race. Ethan and his IMF teammates Benji Dunn and Luther Stickell travel to Abu Dhabi International Airport to intercept the holder of the other key piece, while evading US agents. During the pursuit, the key piece is stolen by a thief named Grace, while Luther and Benji disarm a hoax nuclear device. Ethan suspects foul play after seeing Gabriel, a ruthless Entity liaison with ties to his pre-IMF past. Aborting the mission, the team scatters and Grace escapes to Rome. Grace is apprehended upon arrival, but Ethan rescues her from local authorities, US agents and Paris, an Entity operative. Grace escapes again, while Ethan meets up with Luther and Benji, with Ilsa rejoining them.
